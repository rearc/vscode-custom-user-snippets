# Contributing to Custom User Snippets

## Adding new Custom User Snippets

Each snippet should have a unique and appropriately named directory located under the `snippets/` directory. At a minimum the snippet's directory should contain the following assets:

* A `snippet.json` file containing the snippet's contents.
* A `README.md` file documenting the snippet. This should include a summary, any prerequisites/dependencies, information on how to use the snippet, and any useful reference documents.
